## About

Save your time and effort in planning trips through an automated trip planner. Our state-of-the-art algorithms analyze the available travel options, accommodation and attractions to plan a perfect holiday for you in real-time, which can be further customized and personalized.
* Long gone are the days when travelers used to book packages or contact travel agents
* People want to plan trips on their own. In doing this they have to visit multiple websites to gather information that is fragmented in nature.
* This leads to spending a lot of time and frustration ultimately leading to either planning a substandard trip or dropping the plan altogether
* Tripsonair aims to remove these difficulties by taking the travelersâ€™ requirements and planning the complete trip automatically, thereby reducing the efforts of travelers
* The algorithm takes into account user budget, taste, days of travel and provides the best order of destinations, optimal travel options and daily minute to minute itinerary
* The itinerary schedules attractions/places to visit, hotel checkin/checkout and meals by considering city arrival-departure time, opening-closing timing of the places, hotel location, places in proximity and same direction
* The generated itinerary can be further customized and personalized
